## Orders Management System
### Overview
This repository contains a Spring Boot-based Orders Management System that leverages Kafka Streams for real-time order processing and aggregations. The application is designed to handle order events, perform real-time aggregations (e.g., total revenue, order count, etc.), and produce results to a Kafka topic. It is ideal for use cases such as e-commerce platforms, logistics systems, or any order management system requiring real-time analytics.

### Features
Real-time Order Processing: Consumes order events from a Kafka topic and processes them in real-time.

Aggregations: Performs real-time aggregations such as:
- Total revenue per customer.
- Total number of orders per customer.
- Average order value.
- Top-selling products.

**Scalable:** Built on Kafka Streams, which is designed for high-throughput, low-latency data processing.

**Customizable:** Easily extendable to support additional aggregations or business logic.

**Monitoring:** Integrates with Micrometer for application metrics and monitoring.
